                                                    It's what makes me such a great coder. I take the time to read the docs,
                                                    find the features, and then try them out on my next project.

                        While working with him over the last 5 years, Phil was one of the hardest workers I knew.
                        He was determined, dedicated, focused, and gritty.
                        He answered emails and texts in a timely manner with a problem-solving mindset.
                        Phil has a personality that invites relationships.
                        He is a loveable man who loves interacting with others in a way that makes one feel cared about.
                        When Phil left our company he left a hole.
                        He gave his heart to us and left a lasting friendship and impact."
