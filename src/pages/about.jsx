                            He answered emails and texts in a timely manner with a problem-solving mindset.
                            Phil has a personality that invites relationships.
                            He is a loveable man who loves interacting with others in a way that makes one feel cared about.
                            When Phil left our company he left a hole.
                            He gave his heart to us and left a lasting friendship and impact."
